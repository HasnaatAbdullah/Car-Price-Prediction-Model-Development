# Model Development - Car Price Prediction

In this project, I developed several **prediction models** to estimate the **price of cars** based on multiple variables or features.  
The goal was to understand the relationship between different features and use them to predict the car's price.  
This project helped me gain a better understanding of **model development** and **predictive analytics**.

## **Objectives**

After completing this project, I was able to:

- Develop multiple prediction models for **car price estimation**.
- Understand the relationship between different variables and target values.
- Evaluate model performance and choose the best-fit model.
- Predict car prices based on available features.

## **Project Overview**

In data analytics, **model development** is used to **predict future observations** from the available dataset.  
The dataset includes various **car features** such as brand, mileage, horsepower, engine size, and other specifications.  
Using this data, I built models to estimate the **car price**.

### **Key Questions**

- Is the dealer offering a **fair value** for my trade-in?  
- Am I putting a **fair price** on my own car?  
- How do different car features affect pricing?

### **Steps Followed**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Scaled and normalized numerical features.

2. **Model Development**
   - Built multiple regression models using:
     - **Simple Linear Regression**
     - **Multiple Linear Regression**
     - **Polynomial Regression**
     - **Ridge & Lasso Regression**

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared models using metrics such as:
     - **R² Score**
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
   - Selected the **best-performing model**.

4. **Price Prediction**
   - Used the trained model to predict **car prices** based on given features.
